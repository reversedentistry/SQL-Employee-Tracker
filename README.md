# Creating a Content Management System Using MySQL

## Description
Using MySQL and the Inquirer module, this application allows a user to view and interact with a company's employee database within the terminal. Users can choose to view employees, departments, and roles within the database, and they can choose to add new ones or update employee roles as they see fit. 

### Technologies
- Javascript
- MySQL
- Node.js
>- Inquirer
>- MySQL2
>- Dotenv

## Installation Instructions
```npm i```

## Usage Instructions
For demonstration purposes, please make sure a SQL client is installed. Run the schema and seed files to pre-populate the database. 

Open the terminal and begin the application using either `npm start` or `node index.js`. A list of prompts will appear in the terminal; cycle through them using the arrow keys and select your choice using the Enter key. Prompts will ask you for a combination of manual input as well as selections from the pre-populated data. Prompts that alter or add data will always return a new table with the updated info printed.
